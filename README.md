# 🌾 Early Warning System for Pest Monitoring and Forecasting

This is a full-stack capstone project designed to help monitor pest activity in rice fields and forecast future outbreaks using data-driven models. Developed in partnership with PhilRice-MES, the system provides real-time visualization, pest monitoring, forecasting, and alert generation to support agricultural decision-making.
